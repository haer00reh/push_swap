### Introduction
The Push swap project is a simple yet highly structured algorithmic challenge: you
need to sort data.
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to
manipulate both stacks.
Your goal? Write a C program called push_swap that calculates and displays the
shortest sequence of Push_swap instructions needed to sort the given integers.
Easy?
We’ll see...
